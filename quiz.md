- A: cd new folder
- (B: cd new_folder)
- C: goto new_folder
- D: cdir new_folder

cd=change directory
---

### Q2: Which of the following bash commands is used to check the current directory?
- A: currdir
- (B: pwd)
- C: rmdir
- D: whereis

pwd=print working directory
---

### Q3: The touch command allows the user to create files
- (A: True)
- B: False

touch asd.txt #creates file in current directory for mac
ni asd.txt #creates files in current directory for windows
---

### Q4: Which of the following is an IDE?
- A: Notepad
- B: Wordpad
- C: Vim
- (D: VSCode)

A/B - text editor
C - powerful text editor not full-fledged IDE.
IDE has built-in debugging tools or visual user interface etc...

### Q5: Extensions can be installed in the IDEs to be able to use other functionalities?
- (A: True)
- B: False
---

### Q6: Only the Chrome browser has a developer tool?
- A: True
- (B: False)

All browsers should have a developer tool
-F12/Ctrl+Shift+I
---

### Q7: Which of the following can be done to access the developer tools in Chrome?
- A: Press F12 on the keyboard
- B: Right-click on the browser and select “Inspect”
- C: Press Ctrl+Shift+I on the keyboard
- (D: All of the above)

### Q8: Each programming language has a unique set of keywords and a special syntax for instructions
- (A: True)
- B: False
---

### Q9: A ___ is used to change source code to object code?
- (A: Compiler)
- B: Interpreter
- C: Reader
- D: None of the above

Complier = translate translates a high-level language to bytecode or machine code, executable file(optimise,generate machine/object code) before program is run
Interpreter = directly execute code line by line without translation in machine code or lower level representation. (python,Javascript,Ruby,PHP)
Transpiler = translates source code to another high-level language instead of bytecode/machine code.(babel, tsc)
JIT complier = Complier + Interpreter (Java (with the HotSpot JVM) and JavaScript (in some modern JavaScript engines like V8)

### Q10: Each programming language has some features that are common to each other
- (A: True)
- B: False

Here are a few fundamental features that are often found in programming languages:

Variables and Data Types: Most programming languages provide the ability to declare variables to store and manipulate data. They also offer various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, booleans, and more.

Control Structures: Programming languages include control structures to control the flow of execution within a program. Common control structures include conditionals (if-else statements, switch statements), loops (for loops, while loops), and branching (goto statements in some languages).

Functions or Procedures: Functions or procedures allow developers to encapsulate a block of code into a reusable unit. Functions can accept parameters and return values, enabling modular programming and code reuse.

Operators: Languages provide operators for performing operations on data. These include arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.), relational operators (less than, greater than, equal to, etc.), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and assignment operators.

Input and Output: Programming languages typically provide mechanisms for input and output operations. This allows programs to interact with users or read from/write to files or other devices.

Error Handling: Languages offer error handling mechanisms to handle and manage exceptions or errors that occur during program execution. This may involve try-catch blocks, exception handling, or other error-handling constructs.

Modularity and Code Organization: Many programming languages support modularity and code organization through the use of modules, packages, or namespaces. These features help structure programs into logical units, improve maintainability, and facilitate code reuse.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Several programming languages support object-oriented programming paradigms. OOP allows developers to model real-world entities as objects, encapsulate data and behavior within classes, and employ concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

These features are not exhaustive, and different languages may offer additional features or have their own unique characteristics. The specific combination and implementation of these features can vary across programming languages, catering to different programming paradigms, domains, and levels of abstraction.
